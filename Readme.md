# Redis Notes (Beginner to Advanced)

Learning Redis from beginner to advanced involves building a strong foundation in its core concepts, progressing to practical applications, and mastering advanced features for high-performance systems. Below is a structured roadmap to guide you through this journey, covering key concepts, skills, and tools at each stage. The roadmap assumes familiarity with basic programming concepts and some knowledge of databases.

---

### **Beginner Level: Understanding Redis Basics**
**Goal**: Grasp the fundamentals of Redis, its architecture, and basic operations.

1. **Understand What Redis Is**
   - Learn that Redis is an in-memory, key-value NoSQL database known for speed and simplicity.
   - Explore its use cases: caching, session storage, leaderboards, pub/sub messaging, and real-time analytics.
   - Resources: Official Redis website (redis.io), Redis documentation ("Introduction to Redis").

2. **Setup and Installation**
   - Install Redis locally (Windows, macOS, Linux) or use a cloud service like Redis Enterprise Cloud.
   - Familiarize yourself with the Redis CLI (`redis-cli`).
   - Practice starting/stopping the Redis server and connecting to it.
   - Tools: Docker for containerized setup, RedisInsight for GUI-based interaction.

3. **Core Data Structures**
   - Learn basic Redis data types and their commands:
     - **Strings**: `SET`, `GET`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `APPEND`.
     - **Lists**: `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LPOP`, `RPOP`, `LRANGE`.
     - **Sets**: `SADD`, `SMEMBERS`, `SINTER`, `SUNION`.
     - **Hashes**: `HSET`, `HGET`, `HGETALL`.
     - **Sorted Sets**: `ZADD`, `ZRANGE`, `ZSCORE`.
   - Practice storing and retrieving data using these commands via `redis-cli`.
   - Example: Store a user’s name (`SET user:1:name "Alice"`) and retrieve it (`GET user:1:name`).

4. **Basic Commands and Operations**
   - Learn key management: `DEL`, `EXISTS`, `EXPIRE`, `TTL`.
   - Understand transactions with `MULTI`, `EXEC`, `DISCARD`.
   - Explore basic pub/sub: `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`.
   - Practice: Set a key with a 60-second expiration and verify its TTL.

5. **Connecting Redis with Programming**
   - Choose a programming language (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java) and install a Redis client library (e.g., `redis-py` for Python, `ioredis` for Node.js).
   - Write simple scripts to connect to Redis, set/get keys, and manipulate lists or hashes.
   - Example (Python with `redis-py`):
     ```python
     import redis
     r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
     r.set('key', 'value')
     print(r.get('key'))  # Output: b'value'
     ```

6. **Resources and Practice**
   - Redis University (free courses at university.redis.com).
   - TryRedis (try.redis.io) for interactive CLI practice.
   - Build a small project: Create a simple caching system for a mock API response.

**Milestone Project**: Build a basic to-do list application using Redis lists to store tasks.

### **Intermediate Level: Practical Applications and Optimization**
**Goal**: Apply Redis in real-world scenarios, optimize performance, and explore advanced data structures.

1. **Advanced Data Structures**
   - Deep dive into:
     - **Bitmaps**: `SETBIT`, `GETBIT`, `BITCOUNT` for compact data storage (e.g., user activity tracking).
     - **HyperLogLog**: `PFADD`, `PFCOUNT` for approximate counting (e.g., unique visitors).
     - **Geospatial Indexes**: `GEOADD`, `GEORADIUS` for location-based queries.
   - Practice: Use HyperLogLog to track unique daily visitors to a website.

2. **Persistence and Data Durability**
   - Understand Redis persistence options:
     - **RDB (Snapshotting)**: Periodic disk saves.
     - **AOF (Append-Only File)**: Log every write operation.
   - Configure persistence settings in `redis.conf` (e.g., `save 60 1000` for RDB).
   - Learn trade-offs: RDB for faster recovery vs. AOF for durability.
   - Practice: Enable AOF and test data recovery after a server crash.

3. **Replication and High Availability**
   - Set up master-slave replication for data redundancy.
   - Learn `SLAVEOF` command and replication configuration.
   - Explore Redis Sentinel for automatic failover and high availability.
   - Practice: Configure a master with two replicas and test failover using Sentinel.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Learn about Redis memory management: `INFO MEMORY`, `maxmemory` directive.
   - Understand eviction policies (e.g., `LRU`, `TTL`).
   - Optimize data structures: Use hashes instead of multiple keys for structured data.
   - Monitor performance with `SLOWLOG` and `MONITOR` commands.

5. **Pub/Sub and Messaging**
   - Build a pub/sub system for real-time messaging (e.g., chat application).
   - Use `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `PSUBSCRIBE` for pattern-based subscriptions.
   - Practice: Create a simple notification system where users subscribe to channels.

6. **Integration with Applications**
   - Integrate Redis with a web framework (e.g., Flask/Django for Python, Express for Node.js).
   - Use Redis for:
     - **Caching**: Store API responses to reduce database load.
     - **Session Management**: Store user sessions with expiration.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Use sorted sets or counters for API rate limiting.
   - Example: Cache database query results in Redis with a 5-minute TTL.

7. **Resources and Practice**
   - Redis documentation ("Advanced Topics").
   - Explore Redis Labs blog for use cases.
   - Project: Build a leaderboard for a gaming app using sorted sets.

**Milestone Project**: Create a real-time analytics dashboard (e.g., tracking page views) using Redis HyperLogLog and a web framework.
